### Â¡Hola mundo! ðŸ‘‹â‰§â—‰á´¥â—‰â‰¦

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programation, html and JavaScript in a bootcamp from [Tecnolochicas](https://tecnolochicas.mx/) and I want to know how to use Github
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on tecnology proyects (specially proyects that need program in HTML or Python)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with program in *Python language* and *C++*
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my proyects in HTML, in fact you can ask me about program in HTML if you need help or inspiration 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me, I usually respond quickly the messages on my social media like [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/notifications/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) But also you can send me an email to **mendozamtzdin@gmail.com** 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I prefer to use neutral pronouns but I donÂ´t have any problem if is easier to you to refer to me by femenine pronouns like she/her 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm very young, ~~well i think so,~~ I'm 17 years old
